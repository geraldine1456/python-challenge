# PYTHON CHALLENGE

# Description

The Python Challenge involves analyzing two sets of data based on real-world situations: Financial Data (PyBank) and Election Data (PyPoll). The challenge aims to extract meaningful insights and perform detailed analyses on both datasets.

For the financial data, the script calculates the total number of months, the net total amount of profit and losses, average changes over the period, and identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits with corresponding dates.

For the election data, the script determines the total number of votes cast, lists all candidates who received votes along with the percentage and total number of votes each candidate won, and identifies the winner based on the popular vote.

The challenge setup involves using the VS Code Editor, the OS and CSV modules, and running the scripts via the Git Bash terminal. The CSV files are stored in the Resources folder and the analysis results are stored in the Analysis folder.

This challenge not only enhances technical skills in Python programming, data manipulation, and debugging, but also improves problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills.

The effort is supported by Bootcamp Tutor Sath for code debugging and Microsoft Copilot for additional debugging assistance.

# Installation 
git clone https://github.com/geraldine1456/python-challenge

# Notes
Run the Python scripts using the Git Bash terminal. Using the “Run” button from VS Code may give an error when loading the CSV files. This issue could be related to how the working directory is set when running the script. It’s recommended to use the terminal to ensure the scripts run correctly with the appropriate file paths.
